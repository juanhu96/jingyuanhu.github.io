abstract: Geographic inequalities in access to essential health services are well-documented, extending beyond rural-urban divides to include socioeconomic, racial, and other disparities. Proximity to hospitals, clinics, healthcare providers, and pharmacies varies widely, posing a challenge in deciding where to strategically locate such facilities. Demand for each service depends on local population health, individual preferences, provider capacity, and other factors. This study introduces a novel estimate-then-optimize framework, combining structural demand estimation using the Berry-Levinsohn-Pakes (BLP) approach with a choice-based optimal facility location model to maximize health service utilization. An advantage of this empirical approach is its reliance on aggregate data rather than individual outcomes.
