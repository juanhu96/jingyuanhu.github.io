## About Me
I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Decisions, Operations & Technology Management (DOTM) area at the University of California, Los Angeles, where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor Fernanda Bravo and Professor Elisa Long. My research focuses on ‘implementable’ data-driven decision-making in the public sector, leveraging tools from econometrics, optimization, and machine learning to bridge the gap between theoretical models and real-world applications.
